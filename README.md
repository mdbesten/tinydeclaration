Text mining applied to a Slate-Twitter Contest.

Background
----------
In June 2010 Slate organized a competition for which it invited people to propose a concise description of the declaration of independence and submit it via Twitter. This repository contains the corpus of submissions as well as the method used to obtain this information and the custom functions created to analyze this information. 

Contents
-----
 * `Makefile`: retrieve topical tweets via the twitter API
 * `*.csv`: the tweet corpus
 * `textmining.R`: apply text mining to shed a light on the diversity and appreciation of the tweets as well as the collective creativity of participants.
